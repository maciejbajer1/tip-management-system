A desktop application for managing tips in a restaurant, developed in **C++** using **Qt** and **SQLite**.

## About

This project was created as part of a **Software Engineering** course.  
It was a team project (4 members). I took the role of project manager and implemented the entire application. I was also responsible for a significant part of the remaining project tasks, including documentation and planning.
The main focus of the project was not just code, but everything around it â€” **requirements, documentation, diagrams, testing, usability, etc.**
